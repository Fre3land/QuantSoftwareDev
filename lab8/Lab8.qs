    /// # Summary

    /// circuit. The operation should be performed in-place, meaning the
    /// time-domain output should be in the same order as the frequency-domain
    /// input, not reversed.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## register
    /// A qubit register with unknown length in an unknown state. It is of type
    /// Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic.BigEndian, which can be used with some
    /// arithmetic library operations. Use the unwrap operator (!) to access
    /// the underlying array. For example, to address the first qubit in the
    /// register, use `register![0]`. For more info, see:

    /// # Summary
    /// In this exercise, you are given a quantum register with a single sine
    /// wave encoded into the amplitudes of each term in the superposition.
    ///
    /// For example: the first sample of the wave will be the amplitude of the
    /// |0> term, the second sample of the wave will be the amplitude of the
    /// |1> term, the third will be the amplitude of the |2> term, and so on.
    ///
    /// Your goal is to find the frequency of these samples, and return that
    /// frequency.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## register
    /// The register which contains the samples of the sine wave in the
    /// amplitudes of its terms.
    ///
    /// ## sampleRate
    /// The number of samples per second that were used to collect the
    /// original samples. You will need this to retrieve the correct
    /// frequency.
    ///
    /// # Output
    /// The frequency of the sine wave.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// When using the DFT to analyze the frequency components of a purely real
    /// signal, typically the second half of the output is thrown away, since
    /// these represent frequencies too fast to show up in the time domain.
    /// Here, we can't just "throw away" a part of the output, so if we measure
    /// a value above N/2, it will need to be mirrored about N/2 to recover the
    /// actual frequency of the input sine wave. For more info, see:
    /// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency
